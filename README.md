# This package is deprecated!

This package has been split into two new packages gms (https://github.com/pik-piam/gms) containing its GAMS related functions and lucode2 (https://github.com/pik-piam/gms) containing all the rest. Please use these two packages instead as lucode is not further developed anymore.

# Code Manipulation and Analysis Tools

R package **lucode**, version **3.20.6**

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.com/pik-piam/lucode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/pik-piam/lucode) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1158596.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1158596) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/pik-piam/lucode/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/pik-piam/lucode)

## Purpose and Functionality

A collection of tools which allow to manipulate and analyze code.


## Installation

For installation of the most recent package version an additional repository has to be added in R:

```r
options(repos = c(CRAN = "@CRAN@", pik = "https://rse.pik-potsdam.de/r/packages"))
```
The additional repository can be made available permanently by adding the line above to a file called `.Rprofile` stored in the home folder of your system (`Sys.glob("~")` in R returns the home directory).

After that the most recent version of the package can be installed using `install.packages`:

```r 
install.packages("lucode")
```

Package updates can be installed using `update.packages` (make sure that the additional repository has been added before running that command):

```r 
update.packages()
```
